        <p> During today's class, we discussed html elements,tags and contents. I learned that HTML is a format
             file. The code to declare an html file is <!DOCTYPE html>. The different tags used are <html></html>, <head>
             </head>,<body></body>. The tags are open and closed, but some are self closed with a forward slash. The information
            that goes between an opened and closed tag is called the content. Content can only be displayed to users with the body tag.
